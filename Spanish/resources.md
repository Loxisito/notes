# RAE
- (DLE) [Diccionario de la lengua española](https://dle.rae.es/)
  - The official dictionary.
- (DE) [Diccionario del estudiante](https://www.rae.es/diccionario-estudiante/)
  - The official dictionary “of the student,” but here everything easier to understand
definitions, and each entry goes with an example, so I recommend it the most
especially to intermediate leraners.
- (DPD) [Diccionario panhispánico de dudas](https://rae.es/dpd/)
  - Contains articles on many things that cause difficulty to native speakers.
- (NGLE) [Nueva gramática de la lengua española](https://www.rae.es/gram%C3%A1tica/)
- (ODLE) [Ortografía de la lengua española](http://aplica.rae.es/orweb/cgi-bin/buscar.cgi)

# Others
- [espanolavanzado](https://espanolavanzado.com)
  - Grammar- and expression-focused articles.
- [wordreference](https://www.wordreference.com/)
  - A very friendly bilingual dictionary. Contains conjugation tables.

above them. If you want to use Spanishdict, make sure to only focus on the examples they
provide for the entries, and take examples from the examples tab/section with a grain of salt, as
they often contain errors (for example *asimísmo* have examples with *a sí mismo*, or *si no* is
often misspelled, since the word *sino* exists.
