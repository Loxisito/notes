# Language notes

Hello! I am known in the language learning communities under the nickname of ==Loxisito== (and its iterations). I am an autodidact who studies languages as a hobby. This website/blog is my attempt to provide all the notes I have gathered during my language-learning journey.

I hope you find them useful, although I use these notes mostly to explain things to other learners, which means that many of them are pretty raw and expect you to have some basic knowledge of the language.

I want to update some of them, so any feedback is welcome, although I cannot promise anything.

Feel free to use them for reference.
